Here at Okta, we believe amazing products shape a relationship with their customers 
based on Trust. I think great products are the first step in building this relationship. 
There are many other aspects which do not really count as product but are becoming seemingly 
important in this current age of technology.

  perception of the value of that product.[^Viabilify]

In the current age of technology it is not just necessary to have a product that elegantly, 
and simply solves problems which people face everyday, it is table stakes.
Over the time product experiences have improved considerably and the tolerance 
towards bad products has drastically reduced. Today with the consumerization of the Enterprise, 
design and experience matter for all products regardless of how they’re distributed to the end user.

One of today’s most important pieces of real estates other than the technical specification of the 
product is Product Status/Trust and Customer Support. Having worked on both of these pieces recently 
and dissecting it from many angles I can only imagine what poor development of these pieces would 
do to the business. So here at Okta we reimagined the Okta Trust experience from ground up for our customers.
Developing a ServiceStatus/Trust page presents interesting product and technical challenges.

> Product loyalty follows trust. Communication and Transparency are the cornerstones of Trust.

Lets first look at the Product challenges. The first page which the customers hit when they have 
issues with the product is Product Status/Trust. Consider yourself lucky if it was a stupid browser issue (like cache) 
or issue with their laptop. If not, the customer expects transparency (what exactly is wrong) and 
communication from the Product Status/Trust page.

A Product Status/Trust page is also the page which prospects visit. 
Initially when the product is gaining momentum the amount of prospects visiting the page are more than the customers.

> As the Product starts to mature and gather more customers the Status/Trust page 
  has to also metamorphose into serving that purpose better.
